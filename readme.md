# Expander-RS

Expander is a proof generation backend for Polyhedra Network. It aims to support fast proof generation.

This is the *rust version* of the "core" repo and more on "demo" purpose, we will continue develop on the repo to support more features.

For more technical introduction, visit our markdown files [here](https://github.com/PolyhedraZK/Expander/tree/master/docs/doc.md).

And [here](./tests/gkr_correctness.rs) for an example on how to use the gkr lib.

For more information, see the cpp version of the repo [here](https://github.com/PolyhedraZK/Expander).

## Environment Setup

Before executing setup, please make sure you read through the system requirements, and make sure your CPU is in the list.

```sh
wget -P data https://storage.googleapis.com/keccak8/circuit.txt
wget -P data https://storage.googleapis.com/keccak8/witness.txt
```


## Benchmarks

**Make sure you include `RUSTFLAGS="-C target-cpu=native"` to allow platform specific accelerations.**

Command template:

```sh
RUSTFLAGS="-C target-cpu=native" cargo run --release -- -f [fr|m31ext3] -t [#threads] -s [keccak|poseidon]
```

Concretely if you are running on a 16 physical core CPU for Bn256 scalar field:

```sh
RUSTFLAGS="-C target-cpu=native" cargo run --release -- -f fr -t 16
```

## Correctness test

[Here](./tests/gkr_correctness.rs) we provide a test case for end-to-end proof generation and verification. 
To check the correctness, run the follow standard Rust test command:

```sh
RUSTFLAGS="-C target-cpu=native" cargo test --release -- --nocapture
```

## CLI

Usage:

```sh
RUSTFLAGS="-C target-cpu=native" cargo run --bin expander-exec --release -- prove <input:circuit_file> <input:witness_file> <output:proof>
RUSTFLAGS="-C target-cpu=native" cargo run --bin expander-exec --release -- verify <input:circuit_file> <input:witness_file> <input:proof>
RUSTFLAGS="-C target-cpu=native" cargo run --bin expander-exec --release -- serve <input:circuit_file> <input:ip> <input:port>
```

Example:

```sh
RUSTFLAGS="-C target-cpu=native" cargo run --bin expander-exec --release -- prove ./data/circuit.txt ./data/witness.txt ./data/out.bin
RUSTFLAGS="-C target-cpu=native" cargo run --bin expander-exec --release -- verify ./data/circuit.txt ./data/witness.txt ./data/out.bin
RUSTFLAGS="-C target-cpu=native" cargo run --bin expander-exec --release -- serve ./data/circuit.txt 127.0.0.1 3030
```

To test the service started by `expander-exec serve`, you can use the following command:
```sh
python ./scripts/test_http.py  # need "requests" package
```

## How to contribute?

Thank you for your interest in contributing to our project! We seek contributors with a robust background in cryptography and programming, aiming to improve and expand the capabilities of our proof generation system.
